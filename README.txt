BD2 doesn't allow for video capture on switch, so I had to grab some videos from online! 
I was also wondering if the way I was going to do the enemy behavior (or lack thereof) was alright? I feel like my scope is already relatively wide
so I wanted to cut out the enemy behavior since it didn't feel like it was as important as getting the rest of the aspects in.
